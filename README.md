## Decision-Tree
A simple python script I made while learning about decision trees.
This code demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Classifier for a simple classification task using the Iris dataset.

# Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your environment:
- `sklearn` for machine learning utilities
- `matplotlib` for plotting the decision tree

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
```

# Code Explanaition

- load_iris: Loads the Iris dataset, a popular dataset for classification tasks.
- train_test_split: Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- DecisionTreeClassifier: Initializes a Decision Tree Classifier.
- accuracy_score: Calculates the accuracy of the predictions.
- plot_tree: Visualizes the decision tree.

# Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Run the decision_tree_example.py file

The code will train a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset, print the accuracy, and visualize the resulting decision tree.
